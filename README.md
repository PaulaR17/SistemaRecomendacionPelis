# Movie Recommendation System

This project uses the [Denisse Movies Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/5979622) to build a content-based movie recommendation system. The dataset includes over 1,600 movies with attributes such as titles, synopses, ratings, genres, directors, and more.

### **Objectives**
- Develop a recommendation system using Python.
- Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze movie synopses.
- Build a graphical user interface for user interactions.
- Provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences.

### **Key Features**
1. **Content-Based Recommendations**: Suggest movies similar to a selected one using cosine similarity.
2. **User Profile Recommendations**: Generate recommendations tailored to user preferences (genres, actors, directors, etc.).
3. **Graphical Interface**: A user-friendly application built using Python tools like Streamlit or PyQT.

### **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Streamlit or PyQT for the interface

### **Dataset**
- [Denisse Movies Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/5979622)

### **How to Run**
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Run the application: `python main.py`.
